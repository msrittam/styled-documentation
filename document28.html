<p class="MainHeading">Java with DB2 connection and the query executions</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">In this document, we will explore a segment of Java code that connects to a DB2 database, manages
user credentials, and executes a deletion operation on a login page table. The code demonstrates how
to retrieve user input, establish a database connection, and perform a crucial data deletion task
based on that input. Let’s delve into the details, breaking down each component to ensure clarity
    and understanding for a young audience.</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">The first part of the code captures user input for a username and a password, which are stored in
two string variables, username and pass. The username is retrieved from a text field, tf1, using the
method getText(). This process is vital for any application that requires user authentication, as it
    allows users to specify their credentials before accessing sensitive data.</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">Next, the code attempts to load the DB2 driver, which is necessary for establishing a connection
    with the DB2 database. This is accomplished with the following lines:</p>
<pre class="NormalCodings">
try { Class.forName("com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver"); }
catch (ClassNotFoundException e2) {
    System.out.println("Please include Classpath Where your DB2 Driver is located");
    e2.printStackTrace();
    return;
}
</pre>
<p class="NormalParagraph">In this section, the Class.forName() method is called with the argument "com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver".
If the driver is not found, a ClassNotFoundException will be thrown, which is handled by printing an
error message that instructs the user to include the correct classpath where the DB2 driver is
located. This error handling ensures that the application does not crash unexpectedly, and provides
    helpful feedback to the developer or user regarding the issue.</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">Following the successful loading of the driver, the code establishes a connection to the database
    using the following block:</p>
<pre class="NormalCodings">
String url = "jdbc:db2://localhost:50000/user";
Connection con = (Connection) DriverManager.getConnection(url, "db2admin", "asdfghjkl");
</pre>
<p class="NormalParagraph">Here, a connection URL is created that specifies the database location (localhost), the port number
(50000), and the database name (user). The DriverManager.getConnection() method is then called with
this URL, along with the username (db2admin) and password (asdfghjkl). If the connection is
successful, a message is printed to the console stating, "DB2 Database Connected." This confirms to
    the developer that they can now interact with the database.</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">However, if the connection fails, the program outputs, "Db2 connection Failed," which serves as an
alert for troubleshooting. It’s essential to ensure that the database server is running and
    accessible before attempting to connect.</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">Once connected, the code prepares to delete a record from the login page using a SQL DELETE
    statement. This is where the program takes action based on the user's input:</p>
<pre class="NormalCodings">
PreparedStatement ps = con.prepareStatement("Delete from loginpage WHERE username =(?)");
ps.setString(1, username);
ps.executeUpdate();
</pre>
<p class="NormalParagraph">In this snippet, a PreparedStatement object is created to execute a SQL command that deletes a
record from the loginpage table where the username matches the value entered by the user. The
setString() method is employed to safely insert the user's username into the query, preventing SQL
injection vulnerabilities—a critical aspect of database security. The method executeUpdate() is then
    called to execute the deletion operation.</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">Upon successfully completing the deletion, a message dialog appears to notify the user:</p>
<pre class="NormalCodings">
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Completed Successfully! Data Passed");
</pre>
<p class="NormalParagraph">This dialog serves as user feedback, confirming that the intended action has been carried out
successfully. It’s a simple yet effective way to communicate with users, ensuring they are aware of
    the outcome of their actions.</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">In the event of any errors during the database operations, the code includes a catch block:</p>
<pre class="NormalCodings">
catch(Exception e1) { e1.printStackTrace(); }
</pre>
<p class="NormalParagraph">This block will catch any exceptions that may occur and print the stack trace to the console. It’s a
useful debugging tool, allowing developers to see what went wrong during execution and helping them
    to fix issues as they arise.</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">In summary, this Java code snippet exemplifies how to manage user data in a secure manner by
connecting to a DB2 database, performing a delete operation based on user input, and providing
informative feedback to the user. By clearly explaining each section, we aim to enhance
understanding for anyone studying computer science or software engineering. This foundational
knowledge of database management and Java programming can serve as a stepping stone for more complex
    projects in the future.</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">As technology continues to evolve, learning how to interact with databases securely and efficiently
remains a critical skill for aspiring programmers and engineers. Whether you're building
applications for business, education, or personal projects, mastering these concepts will empower
    you to create robust and user-friendly software solutions.</p>
