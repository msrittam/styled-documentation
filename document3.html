<p class="MainHeading">Managing State in React with Redux</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">In React applications, it can be challenging for sibling components to
    communicate directly. Sibling components cannot pass information to one another, and during
    navigation, they also cannot link directly for routing purposes. For navigation, developers
    often resort to methods like window.open and window.location.replace. However, these methods are
    not ideal for managing shared state between sibling components.</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">To manage information passing between sibling components effectively, we
    can utilize React's built-in context feature. However, the context method does not provide a
    structured way with getter and setter methods. Instead, a more robust solution is to use Redux
    for global state management. Redux is a separate library that we can install to handle the
    application's state more effectively.</p>
<p class="NormalHeading1">Setting Up Redux</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">The Redux store acts as a centralized storage for state in a React
    application. It is bundled with the React application, but it operates independently because it
    is a different library. Inside the Redux store, we create "slices," which are sections of state
    management that can be accessed and manipulated by various sibling components. For example, we
    might define an action type such as change filter and a payload like price: 10 rupees. To
    install Redux, we first run the following commands in our terminal:</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit<br/>
npm install react-redux</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">After installing Redux, we need to connect the Redux store to our React
    application. We do this in the main application file, typically named app.jsx. Here’s how you
    can set up the connection:</p>
<pre class="NormalCodings">
import { Provider as ReduxProvider } from "react-redux"; // Renaming the provider to avoid conflicts
import store from "./store"; // Importing the store
function Application() {
    return (
        &lt;ReduxProvider store={store}>
            &lt;RouterProvider />
        &lt;/ReduxProvider>
    );
}
export default Application;
</pre>
<p class="NormalParagraph">In this code, we wrap our application with the ReduxProvider, allowing
    all components to access the Redux store.</p>
<p class="NormalHeading1">Creating the Redux Store</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">Next, we need to define the Redux store itself. This is typically done in
    a file like src/store/index.js. Here, we import the necessary function to configure our store:</p>
<pre class="NormalCodings">
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
// Creating the Redux store
const store = configureStore({});
export default store;
</pre>
<p class="NormalParagraph">However, this code will produce an error because we need to specify a
    reducer, which is a function that defines how the state is modified based on actions.</p>
<p class="NormalHeading1">Defining Slices</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">A slice in Redux consists of three main properties: the initial state,
    the slice name, and the reducers, which contain the business logic. Let’s create a slice for
    managing flight data. We would typically do this in a file like src/store/slices/flights.js:</p>
<pre class="NormalCodings">
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
const FlightsSlice = createSlice({
    initialState: { flights: [] }, // Initial state with an empty array
    name: "flights", // Name of the slice
    reducers: {
        getFlights: (state, action) => {
            // Setting flight data when the action is dispatched
            state.flights = [{ id: "1", route: "del>blr", price: 10000 }]; } }
});
// Destructuring the actions and reducer from the slice
const { actions, reducer } = FlightsSlice;
const { getFlights } = actions;
export { reducer, getFlights }; // Exporting the reducer and action
</pre>
<p class="NormalParagraph">This slice allows us to store flight data. The getFlights reducer sets
    the flight information in the state when called.</p>
<p class="NormalHeading1">Connecting the Reducer</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">Now that we have created the slice, we need to connect the reducer to
    the store. We can do this in the src/store/index.js file:</p>
<pre class="NormalCodings">
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { reducer } from "./slices/flights"; // Importing the flights reducer
const store = configureStore({ reducer: reducer }); // Adding the reducer to the store
export default store;
</pre>
<p class="NormalHeading1">Accessing Redux State in Components</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">To retrieve and manipulate the flight data in our components, we need to
    use the useDispatch and useSelector hooks from react-redux. These hooks allow us to interact
    with the Redux store easily. Here’s an example of how to set up a component that lists flights:</p>
<pre class="NormalCodings">
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { getFlights } from "/store/slices/flights"; // Importing the action
export default function FlightListing() {
    const dispatch = useDispatch(); // Get the dispatch function to call actions
    const listing = useSelector((state) => state.flights); // Get flight data from the store
    console.log(listing); // Log the current flight listing
    useEffect(() => {
        dispatch(getFlights()); // Dispatch the action to get flights when component mounts
    }, []);
    return &lt;div>Flight Listing&lt;/div>; // Render flight listing
}
</pre>
<p class="NormalParagraph">In this component, we retrieve the flight data from the Redux store and
    dispatch the getFlights action to load the initial flight information when the component
    mounts.</p>
<p class="NormalHeading1">Combining Multiple Reducers</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">When your application grows, you may want to add multiple reducers. It’s
    important to note that you cannot handle asynchronous actions directly within reducers or
    manipulate sibling slices inside any slices. To combine multiple reducers, you can use
    combineReducers from Redux Toolkit. Here’s how to set it up:</p>
<pre class="NormalCodings">
import { configureStore, combineReducers } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { reducer as flightReducers } from "/slices/flights"; // Existing flights reducer
import { reducer as userReducers } from "/slices/user"; // New user slice
const store = configureStore({
    reducer: combineReducers({
        flights: flightReducers, // Combining flight reducers
        user: userReducers // Adding user reducers
    })
});
export default store;
</pre>
<p class="NormalHeading1">Making API Calls in Slices</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">To fetch data from an API, we can use createAsyncThunk. This function
    allows us to define asynchronous actions. Here’s how to implement fetching flights from an API
    in our slice:</p>
<pre class="NormalCodings">
import { createSlice, createAsyncThunk } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
// Creating an async thunk to fetch flights
const fetchFlights = createAsyncThunk("flights/fetchFlights", async () => {
    try { const response = await fetch("http://localhost:3000/flights");
        const json = await response.json();
        return json; // Return the fetched data
    } catch (error) { return []; // Return an empty array in case of an error
    } });
// Define the flights slice
const FlightsSlice = createSlice({
    initialState: { rawFlights: [], flights: [] }, // Initial state with two arrays
    name: "flights",
    reducers: {
        getFlights: (state, action) => {
            state.flights = state.rawFlights; // Set flights from raw data
        } },
    extraReducers: (builder) => {
        // Handle different states of the async action
        builder.addCase(fetchFlights.pending, (state) => {
            state.loading = true; // Set loading state
        });
        builder.addCase(fetchFlights.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
            state.flights = action.payload; // Set flights from API response
            state.rawFlights = action.payload; // Store raw data
            state.loading = false; // Reset loading state
        });
        builder.addCase(fetchFlights.rejected, (state, action) => {
            state.flights = []; // Reset flights on error
            state.rawFlights = action.payload; // Optionally store the payload
            state.loading = false; // Reset loading state
        }); }
});
// Destructuring the actions and reducer
const { actions, reducer } = FlightsSlice;
const { getFlights } = actions;
// Exporting the reducer and actions
export { reducer, getFlights, fetchFlights };
</pre>
<p class="NormalParagraph">In this example, we defined an asynchronous thunk called fetchFlights to
    fetch flight data from an API. The extraReducers section allows us to handle different states of
    the asynchronous call—pending, fulfilled, and rejected. By using Redux, we can effectively
    manage state in React applications, allowing sibling components to share information seamlessly.
    Redux slices enable us to organize our state management into manageable pieces, while
    asynchronous actions allow for data fetching from external APIs. This structured approach to
    state management not only enhances the organization of our code but also improves the
    scalability of our applications. With these tools, young developers can confidently tackle
    complex state management challenges in their React projects.</p>
