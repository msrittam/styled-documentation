<p class="MainHeading">Comprehensive Overview of Final Year Project Development and Learning Experiences</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">In the context of a final year project, the primary objective is to create a user-friendly web
application utilizing ReactJS. This application will incorporate a deep learning model specifically
designed for the detection of diabetic retinopathy using Python. The goal is to achieve an accuracy
level exceeding 78 percent, which is crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment. To accommodate
different user requirements, it is essential to develop various deep learning models that can
    balance speed and accuracy according to user needs.</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">The web application must not only display these functionalities but also allow users to capture
images directly or upload existing retinal images. An important feature of the interface will be a
chart that illustrates the accuracy of each deep learning model available. This will help users make
    informed decisions based on the performance of each model.</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">Additionally, the application will highlight problematic areas in the retinal images. To enhance
user understanding, affected spots will be visually indicated with squares on the images.
Furthermore, image segmentation techniques will be applied to modify the pixel colors in the
affected retinal images. For instance, black spots indicating damage could be transformed into
green, making it easier to identify problem areas. The connection between the frontend, developed in
React, and the backend, built using Python, will be established through an API, ensuring smooth
    communication between the two components.</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">During the course of the project, it has been observed that attempting to create a hybrid model does
not lead to improvements in accuracy. Instead, the accuracy tends to average out, which can be
counterproductive. This finding emphasizes the importance of focusing on developing models that
    specialize in their tasks rather than combining them in ways that dilute their effectiveness.</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">As students prepare for course enrollment, several critical questions often arise. Prospective
students might inquire whether the institution offers an online platform for learning. They may also
want to know if there are regular quizzes to reinforce knowledge, as well as the placement
percentage for recent batches. Interaction with mentors is crucial, so questions about live sessions
    on platforms like Zoom and the frequency of classes are common.</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">Students often seek clarity on whether they can engage directly with their classmates and if there
are opportunities for teamwork. The validity of course recordings and the possibility of balancing
job responsibilities alongside the course are also significant concerns. In terms of project
workload, prospective students frequently ask how many projects they will be assigned, and they may
request examples of previous projects completed by students. Additionally, inquiries about receiving
participation certificates for demo classes and the practical application of taught steps in other
    projects are common.</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">Beyond project discussions, the office learnings provide valuable insights into technologies such as
Kubernetes and container services. Kubernetes, which can be run on platforms like Docker and PWK,
allows for efficient management of containerized applications. Instruction files are typically
    maintained in YAML format, offering clear guidelines on deployment and configuration.</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">Using a private npm registry like Verdaccio can improve the management of dependencies, while a
well-organized folder structure is essential for maintaining clarity in project organization.
Separating pages and presentational components enhances modularity, making the codebase easier to
    navigate and understand.</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">In developing applications, it is critical to utilize array mapping for rendering components
effectively. Implementing functions such as `handleSubmit` and utilizing the `useEffect` hook in
    React allows for efficient handling of API calls and calculations, streamlining the user experience.</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">In conclusion, the journey of developing a final year project not only involves technical skills but
also an understanding of project management and teamwork. The insights gained from office learnings
further enrich the educational experience, equipping students with the necessary tools to excel in
their careers. This holistic approach to learning and application development will ultimately
    prepare students for the challenges they will face in the professional world.</p>
