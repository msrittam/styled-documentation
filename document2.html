<p class="MainHeading">Understanding React Router and Page Navigation</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">In modern web applications, especially those built with React,
    navigation between different pages and components is crucial for creating a seamless user
    experience. One powerful tool for managing this navigation is React Router. This library
    helps developers define how users can navigate through the app, making it easy to connect
    different parts of the application.</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">To begin, we can set up routing by using the createBrowserRouter
    function from React Router. This function is usually imported in a file named routes.jsx.
    Here’s an example of how you can set it up:</p>
<pre class="NormalCodings">
import { createBrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
const Router = createBrowserRouter([
    { path: "/products", element: &lt;ProductsPage /> } ]);
export default Router;
</pre>
<p class="NormalParagraph">In this code, we create a router that listens for the /products path.
    When users navigate to this URL, the ProductsPage component will be displayed. Once we have
    defined our router, we need to provide it to our application. This is done in the main
    application file, often named app.jsx. Here, we can use the RouterProvider component to make
    our router available to the rest of the app:</p>
<pre class="NormalCodings">
import { RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";
import Router from './routes';
function App() {
    return &lt;RouterProvider router={Router} />; }
export default App;
</pre>
<p class="NormalParagraph">With this setup, the RouterProvider acts as the parent element, and
    all components nested within it can utilize the routing functionality provided by React Router.</p>
<p class="NormalHeading1">Linking Between Pages</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">To enable users to navigate between different pages of the application,
    we can use the Link component from React Router. This component allows us to create links that
    change the URL without reloading the entire page. Here's an example of how to implement this in
    the ProductsPage component:</p>
<pre class="NormalCodings">
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
export default function ProductsPage() {
    return ( &lt;div> &lt;Link to="/products">Go to Products&lt;/Link>
            Products Page &lt;/div> ); }
</pre>
<p class="NormalParagraph">In this example, clicking on the link will take users to the /products
    page. It’s important to note that you can also use traditional methods such as window.open or
    window.location.replace for navigation, but using Link is generally preferred in React
    applications for a smoother experience.</p>
<p class="NormalHeading1">Creating Layouts to Avoid Repetition</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">When building applications, you may notice that certain components, like
    headers or sidebars, need to appear on multiple pages. To avoid duplicating code, we can
    introduce a layout component. This layout component can wrap around the individual routes,
    ensuring that common elements are displayed without having to call them in every route.</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">Let’s say we want to enhance our routing to accept dynamic parameters.
    For instance, we might want to display products based on a specific identifier called a "slug".
    Here’s how we can modify our routing:</p>
<pre class="NormalCodings">
import { createBrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
const Router = createBrowserRouter([
    { path: "/products/:slug", element: &lt;ProductsPage /> }
]);
export default Router;
</pre>
<p class="NormalParagraph">In this updated code, the :slug part of the path allows the router to
    accept any value in that position. This is useful for displaying different products based on
    their unique identifiers.</p>
<p class="NormalHeading1">Accessing Dynamic Parameters</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">Inside the ProductsPage, we can access the slug value using the
    useParams hook from React Router. This allows us to fetch and display the specific product
    details dynamically. Here’s how that looks:</p>
<pre class="NormalCodings">
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";
export default function ProductsPage() {
    const params = useParams(); // This retrieves the slug from the URL
    console.log(params); // Outputs the slug to the console
    return &lt;div>Products Page&lt;/div>;
}
</pre>
<p class="NormalParagraph">This method is helpful when you want to change the content displayed
    based on the URL. For example, if the URL is /products/laptop, the params object will contain {
    slug: "laptop" }.</p>
<p class="NormalHeading1">Adding Child Routes</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">To create a more organized structure, you might want to add child
    routes. For instance, if you have different categories or items within the products, you can
    nest routes. Here’s how you can do this:</p>
<pre class="NormalCodings">
import { createBrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
const Router = createBrowserRouter([
    {   path: "/products",
        element: &lt;ProductsPage />,
        children: [ { path: "content1", element: &lt;div>Content1&lt;/div> } ] }
]);
export default Router;
</pre>
<p class="NormalParagraph">In this example, we have a child route called content1 nested under
    /products. To display this content, we can use the Outlet component in the ProductsPage:</p>
<pre class="NormalCodings">
import { Outlet } from "react-router-dom";
export default function ProductsPage() {
    return ( &lt;div> Products Page &lt;Outlet /> {/* Renders child routes here */} &lt;/div> ); }
</pre>
<p class="NormalParagraph">The Outlet serves as a placeholder for rendering the child components
    based on the current route.</p>
<p class="NormalHeading1">Setting Up a Mock Server</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">For development purposes, you may want to set up a simple server that
    can serve mock data, like product information. One way to achieve this is by using JSON Server,
    which is an easy-to-use tool for creating a mock REST API. You can install it and run it with
    the following commands:</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">
npm install json-server<br/>
npm run json-server --watch database.json --delay=1000</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">This command starts a server that watches a database.json file, allowing
    you to test API calls without a backend.</p>
<p class="NormalHeading1">Adding Bootstrap for Styling</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">Finally, to improve the visual appearance of your application, you can
    incorporate Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework. To add Bootstrap to your React project,
    you can run:</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap</p>
<p class="NormalParagraph">After this, you can utilize Bootstrap components in your React
    application, making it more attractive and responsive. In summary, understanding how to use React Router for navigation,
    implement dynamic routes, and utilize child components are essential skills for any aspiring web
    developer. By creating layouts to avoid repetition and integrating tools like JSON Server and
    Bootstrap, you can build robust and visually appealing web applications. With these foundational
    concepts, young learners can confidently explore the exciting world of web development.</p>
